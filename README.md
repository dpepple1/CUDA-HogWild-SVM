## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to explore the potential and limitations of parallelized stochastic gradient descient when executed using an accelerator architecture. In this case, several variants of Support Vector Machines have been implemented using Nvidia CUDA for operation on a GPU. 

## Operation
To build executables run 
```
make all
```
